    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my profile. I am a 30 years of age with a keen interest in computer science and the way technology is evolving. I studied information technology
        At college and progressed onto a foundation degree in computer network security. Shortly after finishing my degree I was setting a network up for an architectural firm which 
        My friend worked at and was offered an apprenticeship in architecture. After doing this for six years I found myself doing the exact same thing day in and day out and wanted a change
        As I like to be mentally challenged frequently. I would like to get back into IT but the cybersecurity side. I have also wanted to learn how to code to gain a further understanding of how computers 
        Generate their information. In my free time I like to go flying at the local flying club with their intention of gaining my pilots license after the pandemic passes by</p>
