    <div class="myDiv">
    <h2>1.1: The importance of IT in modern business</h2>
    <p>	The purpose of information technology is to revolutionize the way we communicate across the globe and efficiently carry 
        out day to day tasks efficiently. From the days of writing letters and waiting days even weeks for them to reach the recipient
        We now have to wait no more than one second in most cases with internet speeds now reaching 1 gigabit per second. Every task we do on a daily basis 
        From typing now saves time and materials as paper is not needed for notes along with ink. Advertising or promoting your products and services now no longer
        Requires you to create a physical poster and take it to peoples houses, this is now done on a computer and sent out to social media sites where millions of people 
        Connect on a regular basis. With the likes of designing buildings this used to be done by multiple people drawing on one large piece of paper just to do one layout
        Whereas nowadays one person sits at a computer and draws this using software such as Autocad, so the speed of the process has increased dramatically as you can 
    Have one person working on a layout each.</p>

        You will be working with CSS which forms the structure of the website and writing code to make it aesthetically pleasing for your potential clients or visitors browsing your
        Page. As most companies have their own website it is vital that someone with these skills designs it for you so it is user friendly and also compatible with the various devices out 
        There such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones. This will not only require the user to have knowledge in the software but also the hardware and having the resources such as internet connectivity 
    To be able to communicate with the outside world (world wide web).</p>

    Training to use the software and the hardware. </p>
