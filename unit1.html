    <h1>Unit 1: Outcome 1</h1>
    <div class="myDiv">
    <h2>1.1: The importance of IT in modern business</h2>
    <p>	The purpose of information technology is to revolutionize the way we communicate across the globe and efficiently carry 
        out day to day tasks efficiently. From the days of writing letters and waiting days even weeks for them to reach the recipient
        We now have to wait no more than one second in most cases with internet speeds now reaching 1 gigabit per second. Every task we do on a daily basis 
        From typing now saves time and materials as paper is not needed for notes along with ink. Advertising or promoting your products and services now no longer
        Requires you to create a physical poster and take it to peoples houses, this is now done on a computer and sent out to social media sites where millions of people 
        Connect on a regular basis. With the likes of designing buildings this used to be done by multiple people drawing on one large piece of paper just to do one layout
        Whereas nowadays one person sits at a computer and draws this using software such as Autocad, so the speed of the process has increased dramatically as you can 
    Have one person working on a layout each.</p>

    <div class="myDiv">
    <h2>1.2. describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
    <p>	Depending what you are doing within your workplace you will be required to use a computer and software of some sort for example if your company designs websites
        You will be working with CSS which forms the structure of the website and writing code to make it aesthetically pleasing for your potential clients or visitors browsing your
        Page. As most companies have their own website it is vital that someone with these skills designs it for you so it is user friendly and also compatible with the various devices out 
        There such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones. This will not only require the user to have knowledge in the software but also the hardware and having the resources such as internet connectivity 
    To be able to communicate with the outside world (world wide web).</p>
</div>
<div class="myDiv">
    <h2>1.3. Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h2>
    <p>To carry out making my website I will use the Japanese Kanban method which translates to do, doing and done. A great website for this is Trello that allows the user to apply activity cards for each section and mark them off once completed. HTML language will be used to structure the website out and CSS to apply the graphics transforming it from a vanilla layout to an eye catching website.</p>
</div>
<div class="myDiv">
    <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h2>
    <p>	With hackers keener than ever to gain access to valuable information and even causes disruption to businesses and bring down peoples website.
        Security plays one of the most vital parts within the digital world and with no website your business becomes useless. There is also the possibility of the internet going down which can happen,
    Also you can face difficulties if hardware fails such as computers, servers and tablets.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="myDiv">
    <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
    <p>	Depending what you are doing in your organization you will be required to use software and sometimes there is limitations whether you are using windows or mac. So hardware comes into play
        Also as if you are doing a graphically demanding process such as a game developer you will need a powerful machine with a changeable graphics card for when new versions are released. All of this requires
    Training to use the software and the hardware. </p>
</div>
    <div class="myDiv">
 <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control </h2>
    <p>Trello helped me to plan the structure of the website and add tasks for each section. This was extremely helpful when designing the game between the whole team having set different tasks and spread the work load evenly. Github helps to manage a project between multiple team members whist keeping the master files protected. This also keeps back ups online incase the originals was to be deleted or lost.</p> 
    </div>
    <div class="myDiv">
    <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
    <p>	GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is the protection of your personal information that companies store about yourself such as address, phone number and date of birth. There is a limit of what information they can hold on you and 
        How long they can obtain it (usually 3 months) when it is no longer needed they must delete it or they can face a fine of 4% global annual turn over or 150, 000 euros (whichever is greater) this was introduced
        14th of April 2016 and became enforceable on 25th May 2018. It was introduced to protect peoples information that companies contain to stop un wanted people gaining access to which may lead to 
    Fraud or criminal activity being carried out using their information. Most companies store this information digitally on a server and they must ensure that it is secure and unavailable to hackers.</p>  
</div>
<h1>Unit 1 Outcome 2</h1>
<div class="myDiv">
<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
<p>The tools I used for the website are visual studio code for the implementation of the structure then a CSS add in for the visuals. I also used Trello to set the tasks of the Japanese Kanban method of Do, Doing and Done. The tools were fairly simple to use and was easy to identify any bugs to be amended. Github was used to create a repository of the website where multiple people can amend the master file. This can also be handy for creating online backups<p>
</div>
<div class="myDiv">
<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
<p>The tools were key to the success of the website due to the way Trello sets out the tasks to be completed and the cards can not be moved to completed unless they are complete. Visual studio code had a friendly user interface and underlined code if any errors occurred. Github helps all of the team collaborate on the same file without corrupting the original. Slack was used for the communication between team members and to send files between each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="myDiv">
<h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your ﬁnal project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
<p>	After reviewing my website I found that the background of the paragraph text was not aesthetically pleasing, so I made some changes to the colour until I was happy. There is still a lot I would like to add but due to the time restraints this was limiting the content to add. The welcome banner at the top was not fitting the page so I added the flex box to it and also adjusted the navbar so that the differen units are on seperate pages.</p>
</div>
<div class="myDiv">
<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2> 
<p>I would like an introduction video on my website and maybe even create my own logo using illustrator and background image. I would like to play around with the nav bar and make it a lot more interesting in the way that the drop down menu can be presented. It would also be good to add my linked in account into the contact area. A few more images would be good to show my hobbies and maybe even the game loaded to a seperate page that the team worked on.</p>  
</div>
<div class="myDiv">
<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are ﬁt for purpose</h2>
<p>The website seems to work so far after reviewing on Github and now the layout seems to work and be aesthetically pleasing to the eye. I had some issues with the navbar but after playing around this was amended. The welcome banner at the top had the flex command added to it so that it adjusted to the size of the screen. Finally the navbar was implemented so that the different units had seperate pages.</p>
</div>
<h1>Unit 1 outcome 3</h1>
<div class="myDiv">
<h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h2>
<p>The benifits of of some of the IT tools was that VS Code allowed for the initial creation of the project using a text based layout and trello and Github allowed me to organise the tasks needed to complete the project. Github also allowed for other developers to view my work and suggest alterations if needed. Trello also allowed for good communication between my team and allowed for everyone to know where they was upto with specific tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="myDiv">
<h2>3.2 I can describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
<p>To improve productivity you can set out tasks for the day using something such as Trello. This allows for team manager to set outtasks for their team usint "to do" cards. Each team member will then carry out the task and then move the card to compleded or for review. It is also ideal for the team members to communicate throughout the project in case someone comes across any problems that another team member may be able to fix, such as a bug in the line of code.</p>
</div>
<div class="myDiv">
<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects</h2>
<p>Going forward with another project in the future I would plan the project myself using a Trello board so that I can organise what needs to be done for an indavidual project. Knowing that I was doing this project alone I would have more time and not need to worry about where each team member is up to. I would then use Github to share my project and listen to any suggestions that people may have further down the line and incorporate them if necassery.</p>
</div>
<div class="myDiv">
<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
<p>I would have a blank chrome page open and any changes being made such as headings or text boxes, I can just refresh the page after typing the changes and see the changes instantly in the chrome browser. This then allows me to make changes where needed and even copy heading sizes or fonts used</p>
