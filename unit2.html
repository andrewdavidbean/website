<h1>Unit 2: Outcome 1</h1>

<h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
<p>With my website I would like to add the navigation bar so that users can select a different page for each unit and the home page just displays the about me section. This bar will have colour and be unique to catch the eye so the user knows where to go. A back to top section would be good too to save the user from scrolling up manually. A big welcome sign at the top using a jpeg image. An about me would be good to have and a clickable link to my linked in profile.</p>

<h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
<p>Copyright protects your work and avoids others using your own work as their own. This can be avoided by using other peoples work as your own or referencing where you got the information from. If you create your own images or content then this is identified of your own and will not be subject to copyright unless someone else uses it.</p>

<h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>
<p>When it comes to designing your web page it is vital to take into account that some people may have disabilities such as being colour blind or have epilepsy so having strobing lights and banners would not be appropriate. Having a user friendly interface and strong colours will help people with the disabilities. Also avoiding small pictures and making them as large as possible for people to see and reduction of blue light.</p>

<h2>	1.7 Describe which are the appropriate Ô¨Åletypes for websites
</h2>
<p>	
    MP3 is an audio file type, mp4 is a video format and jpeg/jpg and png are picture file types. Pdf files can be used for downloadable menus or brochures. Sometimes a picture can add elligence to a website rather than just being text based. Some people have different learning styles such as audio or video.</p>
